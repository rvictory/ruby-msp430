Hopefully going to be a Ruby DSL for basic MSP-430 programming.

It will look something like this (ideally):

configure_io do
    @led     = port1.pin1.out
    @switch  = port1.pin2.in
end

program_loop do
    @led.toggle
    wait_seconds(1)
end

I also hope to have syntax for defining interrupt handlers and more complex logic (setting up shift registers, SPI, PWM, etc.)

Running the ruby program will produce C or ASM code to drive the application, ASM will be if I'm feeling very ambitious
